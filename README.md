# 📋 Project Overview
The Maternal Risk Prediction project aims to predict maternal health risks during pregnancy using advanced machine learning techniques. This end-to-end solution includes:

◾ Data preprocessing and feature engineering for improved model accuracy.
◾ Model training and evaluation using Random Forest and Logistic Regression algorithms.
◾ API Deployment for real-time risk prediction with a user-friendly front-end interface.

This project demonstrates the implementation of MLOps practices to address critical health challenges.
